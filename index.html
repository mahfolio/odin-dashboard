    <p>The year 1866 was signalised by a remarkable incident, a mysterious and inexplicable phenomenon, which doubtless no one has yet forgotten. Not to mention rumours which agitated the maritime population and excited the public mind, even in the interior of continents, seafaring men were particularly excited. Merchants, common sailors, captains of vessels, skippers, both of Europe and America, naval officers of all countries, and the Governments of several States on the two continents, were deeply interested in the matter. For some time past vessels had been met by “an enormous thing,” a long object, spindle-shaped, occasionally phosphorescent, and infinitely larger and more rapid in its movements than a whale.

    <p>The train, which was going at a great speed, was suddenly brought to a standstill. The engine-driver had seen a herd of buffaloes crossing the line. There were at least ten thousand of them. They were crossing the railway from south to north. The train was obliged to wait until they had passed. This took three hours. Phileas Fogg was not in the least disconcerted. He looked upon this delay as one of the incidents of his journey. He had provided for such a contingency. He was not a man to be put out by trifles.</p>
